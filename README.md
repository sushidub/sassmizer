# Sassmizer
Sassmizer is an ongoing collection of [Dart Sass 1.43.4](https://github.com/sass/dart-sass/releases/tag/1.43.4) mixins, functions, and utilities that I've found to be repeating patterns in most development projects I've been involved with. I try to keep them up to date with the latest version of dart-sass and backwards compatible up to the last three releases.

```scss
@import "sassmizer";
 // -or-
@use 'sassmizer';
```
