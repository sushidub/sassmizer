# Sassmizer
Sassmizer is an ongoing collection of Sass mixins, functions, and utilities that I've found to be repeating patterns in most development projects I've been involved with. I try to keep them up to date with the latest version of dart-sass and backwards compatible up to the last three releases.

```scss
@import "sassmizer";
 // -or-
@use 'sassmizer';
```
